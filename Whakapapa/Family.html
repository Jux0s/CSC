        <h1>Where My Story Begin</h1>
        <p>Family is a big part of Cambodian life. In my family, we value respect, helping each other, and spending time together. We always gather for meals, celebrate holidays like Khmer New Year, and support each other through everything.</p>
        <p>One thing I love about my family is how we pass down traditions, like cooking special dishes or telling stories about our past. These moments help me feel proud of where I come from.</p>
